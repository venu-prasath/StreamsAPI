# Java Streams API Exploration

## About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with and documenting the various use cases and capabilities of the **Java Streams API**. Introduced in Java 8, the Java Streams API has become an essential part of modern Java development, enabling developers to process data more efficiently, write more concise and readable code, and perform declarative programming for collections and data sources.

The **goal** of this repository is to serve both as a learning resource and a reference for anyone looking to understand or explore:

- Different ways to utilize the Java Streams API.
- Various real-world use cases of Streams, ranging from simple operations to complex pipeline processing.
- Best practices, common patterns, and pitfalls to avoid when working with Streams.

## Why Build This Project?

The Java Streams API is a powerful tool, but it can initially be challenging for those unfamiliar with functional programming concepts or those transitioning from imperative programming styles. This repository was created to address these challenges by:

1. **Learning Through Experimentation**  
   We explore how the Streams API works by experimenting with a wide range of real-world use cases, practical code examples, and simple problems.

2. **Documentation of Use Cases**  
   Developers often encounter situations where they need to make sense of Streams in application scenarios like filtering, mapping, reducing, or parallel processing. This repository aims to clearly document these cases for quick reference.

3. **Showcasing Alternative Approaches**  
   The Streams API is versatile and can often achieve the same goal in different ways. We highlight these variations, offering insights into where each approach may be more beneficial.

4. **Encouraging Best Practices**  
   By exploring common pitfalls and anti-patterns, this project aims to promote idiomatic usage of the Streams API to improve code quality, maintainability, and performance.

## What You'll Find Here

This repository includes:

- **Basic Examples:** Foundational concepts to understand how the Streams API works, such as map, filter, and reduce.
- **Intermediate Use Cases:** Demonstrations of stream operations like grouping, partitioning, and parallel processing.
- **Advanced Topics:** More complex scenarios, performance optimizations, and custom collectors.
- **Comparisons:** When to use Streams vs other traditional approaches.
- **Code Examples:** Fully documented and self-contained Java classes for each use case, with explanations included.

### Topics Covered

- Stream Creation and Pipeline Process
- Intermediate Operations (e.g., `filter`, `map`, `flatMap`, `sorted`, etc.)
- Terminal Operations (e.g., `collect`, `forEach`, `reduce`)
- Parallel Streams and Performance Considerations
- Stream Collectors and Advanced Collection Techniques
- Error Handling in Streams
- Streams with Primitives (`IntStream`, `LongStream`, etc.)
- Real-World Use Cases
    - Data Transformation
    - Aggregations (Sum, Averages, etc.)
    - Complex Grouping and Partitioning
- Combining Streams with Optional and Records (Java 14+)
- Debugging and Testing Streams

## System Requirements

- **Java Version:** This project uses **Java 21**. Ensure that Java 21 is properly installed and configured to build and run the provided samples.
